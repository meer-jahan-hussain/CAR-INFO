                BMW’s M Servotronic steering system in the M5
                CS provides a finely tuned blend of precision and feedback. With variable steering
                ratio, the system adjusts to driving conditions for agile response at low speeds and
                rock-solid stability at high speeds. Whether carving through backroads or cruising the
                autobahn, the steering delivers a direct connection between driver and road.

                Braking performance in the M5 CS is handled
                by standard M Carbon Ceramic brakes, identifiable by their gold-painted calipers. These
                brakes provide exceptional stopping power, fade resistance, and weight savings compared
                to traditional systems, ensuring the M5 CS can decelerate as confidently as it
                accelerates—even under extreme track conditions.
