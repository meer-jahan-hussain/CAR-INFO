                The Rolls-Royce Phantom is equipped with a
                6.75-liter twin-turbocharged V12 engine that produces around 563 horsepower and 664
                lb-ft of torque. It’s designed to deliver smooth, near-silent acceleration with
                effortless power delivery, staying true to the brand’s signature "waftability" — where
                the engine feels like it glides rather than accelerates.

                The Phantom features large, polished alloy
                wheels—typically 21 or 22 inches—paired with specially designed, noise-reducing tires.
                These tires include a layer of foam inside to minimize road noise, enhancing the quiet,
                serene cabin experience that Rolls-Royce is known for.

                The car uses an electrically assisted power
                steering system that provides light, effortless turning at low speeds and firm,
                confident handling at high speeds. The Phantom also includes rear-wheel steering, which
                allows the rear wheels to turn slightly to improve agility in tight spaces and increase
                stability on the highway.

                Inside the Phantom, every seat is a
                masterpiece of luxury, offering full customization in terms of materials, stitching, and
                design. All seats come with features like heating, cooling, massage functions, and
                memory settings, ensuring maximum comfort for every passenger, especially in the rear
                where executive-class seating is available.

                The Phantom is fitted with large ventilated
                disc brakes and advanced braking technology, including ABS (anti-lock braking system),
                electronic brake-force distribution, and regenerative braking. These ensure that despite
                its size and weight, the Phantom stops smoothly and safely, with minimal noise or
                vibration.
