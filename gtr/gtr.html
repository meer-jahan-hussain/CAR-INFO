            The Nissan GT-R is powered by a 3.8-liter twin-turbocharged V6 engine, famously
            known as the VR38DETT. This hand-built engine produces around 565 horsepower,
            while the NISMO version delivers up to 600 horsepower. The GT-R can accelerate
            from 0 to 100 km/h in about 2.9 seconds, making it one of the fastest production
            cars in the world. The engine is paired with a 6-speed dual-clutch automatic
            transmission, delivering lightning-fast gear shifts and exceptional
            performance.

            The Nissan GT-R comes equipped with 20-inch forged alloy wheels, designed for
            strength and lightweight performance. It uses high-performance tires (such as
            Dunlop or Michelin, depending on variant) that provide excellent grip and
            stability at high speeds. The wide tire setup ensures strong traction during
            acceleration, cornering, and braking, giving the GT-R its legendary
            road-holding ability.
