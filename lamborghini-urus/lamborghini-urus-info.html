                The Lamborghini Urus is
                powered by a 4.0-liter
                twin-turbocharged V8
                engine that
                produces an exhilarating 657 horsepower and 850 Nm of torque. This powerhouse propels the
                Urus
                from 0 to
                100
                km/h in just 3.3 seconds, making it one of the fastest SUVs in the world. Engineered for
                high
                performance
                and smooth power delivery, the V8 delivers relentless acceleration, a deep exhaust note, and
                the
                thrill
                of a
                true Lamborghini supercar in an SUV body.

                only
                enhance its muscular stance but also improve aerodynamics and handling. Wrapped in specially
                developed
                Pirelli P Zero tires, the setup delivers superior grip, precise cornering, and excellent
                road

                Whether you’re carving through mountain roads or cruising on the highway, the wheels and

                steering
                system
                paired with rear-wheel steering for outstanding agility and stability. At low speeds, the
                rear
                wheels
                turn
                in the opposite direction of the front for tighter turning, while at high speeds, they turn
                in the
                same
                direction for smoother lane changes and cornering. The steering is sharp, responsive, and
                finely
                tuned
                to
                give the driver a confident, connected feel at all times.

                Inside the Urus, the seating strikes a perfect

                race-inspired
                design
                and first-class comfort. The standard front sport seats offer 12-way power adjustment, with
                optional

                ventilated, and massage functions for added luxury. Finished in premium leather with
                Lamborghini’s
                signature
                stitching and customization options, the seats provide both the ergonomic support for

                Braking performance in the Lamborghini Urus is
                unmatched, thanks to
                the
                inclusion of
                massive carbon-ceramic disc brakes—the largest ever fitted to an SUV. These high-performance
                brakes
                offer
                exceptional stopping power, fade resistance, and thermal stability, even under extreme
                driving
                conditions.
                Whether navigating traffic or charging down a mountain road, the Urus’s braking system
                delivers
                precise
                control and confidence-inspiring performance.
